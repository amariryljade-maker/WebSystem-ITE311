# Step 2: Quick Summary ✅

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Date:** October 20, 2025

## What Was Step 2?

Modify the login process so that **all users** redirect to a **unified dashboard**, with **role-based conditional checks** to display different content based on the user's role from session.

---

## ✅ What's Already Implemented

### 1. Unified Redirect (Line 355)
```php
// ALL users go to same endpoint
return redirect()->to('/dashboard');
```

### 2. Role-Based Controller Logic (Lines 463-485)
```php
switch ($user['role']) {
    case 'admin':
        // Load admin data
        break;
    case 'instructor':
    case 'teacher':
        // Load teacher data
        break;
    case 'student':
        // Load student data
        break;
}
```

### 3. Role-Based View Conditionals (Lines 74-767)
```php
<?php if ($user['role'] === 'admin'): ?>
    <!-- Admin dashboard -->
<?php elseif ($user['role'] === 'instructor' || $user['role'] === 'teacher'): ?>
    <!-- Teacher dashboard -->
<?php else: ?>
    <!-- Student dashboard -->
<?php endif; ?>
```

## 🧪 Testing

Test each role by logging in:

```
Admin:      admin@lms.com         → Shows system stats
Teacher:    john.smith@lms.com    → Shows courses
Student:    alice.wilson@student.com → Shows enrollments
```

All redirect to: `http://localhost/ITE311-AMAR/dashboard`
