# STEP 6: CONFIGURE ROUTES - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## 📋 Overview

The routes configuration at `app/Config/Routes.php` has been **completely enhanced** with:
1. ✅ **Comprehensive route groups** for all user roles
2. ✅ **Authentication filters** for protected routes
3. ✅ **RESTful URL patterns** for all navigation links
4. ✅ **API routes** for AJAX functionality
5. ✅ **Error handling** and fallback routes

---

## 🎯 Route Structure

### **Route Organization:**
```php
1. Authentication Routes (public + protected)
2. Admin Routes (protected)
3. Teacher Routes (protected)
4. Instructor Routes (protected)
5. Student Routes (protected)
6. Common Routes (protected)
7. Public Routes
8. API Routes (protected)
9. Error Routes
```

## 📊 ROUTE MAPPING TO NAVIGATION

### **Admin Navigation → Routes:**
```php
Manage Users    → /admin/users
Manage Courses  → /admin/courses
Reports         → /admin/reports
System Settings → /admin/settings
```

### **Teacher Navigation → Routes:**
```php
My Courses      → /teacher/courses
Lessons         → /teacher/lessons
Quizzes         → /teacher/quizzes
Assignments     → /teacher/assignments
My Students     → /teacher/students
```

### **Instructor Navigation → Routes:**
```php
My Courses      → /instructor/courses
Resources       → /instructor/resources
Schedule        → /instructor/schedule
Assignments     → /instructor/assignments
My Students     → /instructor/students
```

### **Student Navigation → Routes:**
```php
My Courses      → /student/courses
Assignments     → /student/assignments
Quizzes         → /student/quizzes
Grades          → /student/grades
Progress        → /student/progress
```

## 🧪 TESTING THE ROUTES

### **Test Authentication Routes:**
```bash
# Public routes (should work without login)
GET  /login
GET  /register
GET  /courses

# Protected routes (should redirect to login)
GET  /dashboard
GET  /admin/users
GET  /teacher/courses
```

### **Test Role-Specific Routes:**
```bash
# Login as admin and test
GET  /admin/users
GET  /admin/courses
GET  /admin/reports

# Login as teacher and test
GET  /teacher/courses
GET  /teacher/lessons
GET  /teacher/students

# Login as student and test
GET  /student/courses
GET  /student/grades
GET  /student/progress
```

### **Test API Routes:**
```bash
# Test API endpoints (with authentication)
GET  /api/dashboard/stats
GET  /api/notifications/unread-count
GET  /api/user/profile
```
