## 🎨 Understanding Colors

- 🟢 **Green (✅ SECURE)** = GOOD! System blocked the attack
- 🔵 **Blue (ℹ️ INFO)** = Information, usually OK
- 🔴 **Red (❌ VULNERABLE)** = BAD! Need to fix

**You want ALL GREEN!** 🟢🟢🟢

```

**This means**:

- ✅ Your system is SECURE

**This is NOT an error!** It's security working correctly.
